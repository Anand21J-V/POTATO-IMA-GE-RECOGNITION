A Potato Leaf Disease Detection project involves the use of technology, typically machine learning and computer vision techniques, to identify and classify diseases affecting potato plants based on their leaf images. This type of project can be beneficial for farmers as it allows for early detection of diseases, which can help in timely intervention and prevention of further spread.

The Potato Leaf Disease Detection project aims to develop a system that can accurately identify and classify diseases affecting potato plants by analyzing images of their leaves. Early detection of diseases is crucial for crop management, and this project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to provide an efficient and reliable solution.

To categories potato leaves into this three classes-healthy leaves, early blight and late blight.
